## Seamod Theme for conky 
This is a conky theme and works perfect in Ubuntu 16.04. 

### Package Dependencies

 > sudo apt-get install lm-sensors,hd-temp,curl,conky-all,dmidecode

After installing above packages you need to change permission of following packages

> sudo chmod u+s /usr/sbin/hddtemp

> sudo chmod u+s /usr/sbin/dmidecode

*other wise hdd tempeture & main board info + tempeture won't work

Now for pretty looks we need to install 2 fonts STYLBCC.ttf and Poky.ttf.
